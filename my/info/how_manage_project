You can manage this project using the commands defined in the Makefile. Here are the main commands:

- **Build the database program:**  
  ```
  make db
  ```
  This compiles db.c into an executable named db.

- **Run the database:**  
  ```
  make run
  ```
  This runs the compiled program with mydb.db as the database file.

- **Clean build and database files:**  
  ```
  make clean
  ```
  This removes the compiled executable and any `.db` files.

- **Run tests:**  
  ```
  make test
  ```
  This runs tests using RSpec (if you have Ruby and RSpec set up).

- **Format C code:**  
  ```
  make format
  ```
  This formats all `.c` files using `clang-format` with the Google style.

You can run these commands in your terminal from the project directory.
