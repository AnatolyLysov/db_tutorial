In the context of your db.c file, the **Main loop commands** are the commands that the database program accepts from user input in its main loop. These include:

### 1. **Meta-commands** (start with a dot `.`)
- `.exit` — Exit the program.
- `.btree` — Print the B-tree structure (for debugging/learning).
- `.constants` — Print internal constants (for debugging/learning).

### 2. **SQL-like commands**
- `insert <id> <username> <email>` — Insert a new row into the database.
- `select` — Retrieve and display all rows in the database.

**How it works:**  
When you run the program (e.g., with `make run`), it enters a loop where it:
1. Prompts for input.
2. Reads a line from the user.
3. If the line starts with `.`, it treats it as a meta-command.
4. Otherwise, it parses the line as an SQL statement (`insert` or `select`).
5. Executes the command and prints the result or error.

**Example session:**
```
db > insert 1 alice alice@email.com
Executed.
db > select
(1, alice, alice@email.com)
db > .exit
```
