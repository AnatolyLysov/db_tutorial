The db.c file is the main source code for a simple, custom-built database engine. Hereâ€™s a high-level explanation of its structure and functionality:

---

### 1. **Includes and Type Definitions**
- Includes standard C libraries for file I/O, memory, and string handling.
- Defines several structs and enums:
  - `InputBuffer`: Handles user input.
  - `Row`: Represents a database row (with `id`, `username`, `email`).
  - `Statement`: Represents a parsed SQL statement (insert/select).
  - Various enums for command and execution results.

---

### 2. **Constants and Macros**
- Defines constants for column sizes, page size, and maximum pages.
- Macros and constants help with memory layout for rows and B-tree nodes.

---

### 3. **Pager and Table**
- `Pager`: Manages reading/writing pages (blocks of data) from/to the database file.
- `Table`: Represents the database, holding a pointer to the pager and the root page number.

---

### 4. **B-tree Node Management**
- Functions and constants for managing B-tree nodes (internal and leaf nodes).
- Handles node types, keys, children, and splitting nodes when they get full.

---

### 5. **Cursor**
- `Cursor`: Used to iterate over rows in the table.
- Functions for moving the cursor, finding rows, and advancing to the next row.

---

### 6. **Serialization**
- Functions to serialize/deserialize `Row` structs to/from memory for storage in pages.

---

### 7. **Database Operations**
- **Insert**: Adds a new row to the table, handling duplicates and splitting nodes if necessary.
- **Select**: Reads and prints all rows from the table.

---

### 8. **Meta-commands**
- Handles commands starting with a dot (`.exit`, `.btree`, `.constants`).
- `.exit` closes the database and exits.
- `.btree` prints the B-tree structure.
- `.constants` prints internal constants.

---

### 9. **SQL Statement Parsing**
- Parses user input into `Statement` structs (supports `insert` and `select`).

---

### 10. **Main Loop**
- Reads user input, parses it, and executes the appropriate command or SQL statement.
- Handles errors and prints results.

---

### **Summary**
- The file implements a basic, persistent, single-table database using a B-tree for storage.
- It supports inserting and selecting rows, and manages data on disk using paging.
- The code is modular, separating concerns like input handling, storage, and B-tree logic.
